### Tools and Technologies
- __IBM Sterling__ - IBM Sterling is a sftp gateway that allows for secure file transfer between systems. It is used to transfer files between the client and the server.
- __FileX__ - FileX is a file transfer tool that allows for secure file transfer between systems. It is used to transfer files between the client and the server.

- __PGP Encryption__ - PGP encryption is used to encrypt files before transferring them between systems. It ensures that the files are secure during transfer.

-__uiPath__ - UiPath is a robotic process automation tool that automates repetitive tasks. It is used to automate file transfers between systems.

- __S3 Bucket__ - S3 bucket is a storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. It is used to store files securely and allows for easy access to the files.

- __AWS Lambda__ - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services. It is used to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

In .NET development, **technology** and **tools** serve different purposes but are closely related:  

### **Technology**  
- Refers to the **frameworks, platforms, and programming languages** used to build applications.  
- Defines the **architecture, design patterns, and methodologies** for software development.  
- Examples in .NET:  
  - **ASP.NET Core** (for web applications)  
  - **Entity Framework Core** (for ORM and database access)  
  - **Razor** (for building interactive web UIs)  
  - **Microservices Architecture**  

### **Tools**  
- Refers to **software applications and utilities** that assist in the development, debugging, deployment, and maintenance of .NET applications.  
- Helps developers **write, test, and manage** code efficiently.  
- Examples in .NET:  
  - **Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code** (IDE for development)  
  - **NuGet** (package manager for .NET libraries)  
  - **Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD and version control)  
  - **Postman** (for testing APIs)  
  - **SonarQube** (for static code analysis)  
  - **Docker & Kubernetes** (for containerization and orchestration)  

### **Key Difference**  
- **Technology** is what you use to **develop** applications (e.g., ASP.NET Core).  
- **Tools** are what you use to **support** development, debugging, and deployment (e.g., Visual Studio, NuGet).
